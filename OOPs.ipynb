        "### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to model real-world entities. Objects are instances of classes and contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions). OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and a clear structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in OOP. It defines attributes and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. Essentially, a class outlines the structure and operations of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "   An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity created based on the class, with its own unique attributes and can perform actions through methods defined in its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "   - **Abstraction** is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "   - **Encapsulation** is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "   Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (`__method_name__`). Examples include `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__`. These methods allow for operator overloading and defining behavior for built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n",
        "   Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to have the same name but to behave differently depending on the object they are acting upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "   Encapsulation is achieved by defining classes with private (or protected) variables and methods. In Python, this is done by prefixing attribute or method names with an underscore (`_`) for protected members, or double underscores (`__`) for private members.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "   A constructor is a special method `__init__()` in Python that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **What are class and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "   - **Class methods** are methods bound to the class and not the instance. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and receive the class as the first argument (`cls`).\n",
        "   - **Static methods** are methods that don't depend on class or instance. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and don't take `self` or `cls` as their first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "   Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments. Python doesn't support traditional method overloading directly but can be simulated using default arguments or variable-length argument lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "   Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "   A property decorator in Python (`@property`) is used to define methods that act like attributes. It allows you to create getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute without directly accessing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "   Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in code. It allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different types, leading to more reusable and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. **What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "   An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is intended to be subclassed. It contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. The `abc` module in Python provides the tools to define abstract classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. **What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "   The advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "   - **Code reusability** through inheritance.\n",
        "   - **Modularity** due to encapsulation.\n",
        "   - **Scalability** by easily extending classes.\n",
        "   - **Maintainability** with clear structure and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "   - **Class variables** are shared by all instances of the class and are defined inside the class but outside any methods.\n",
        "   - **Instance variables** are unique to each instance of the class and are typically defined inside the `__init__` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "   Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one class. Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.**\n",
        "   - **`__str__`** is used to define a user-friendly string representation of an object. It's called when `print()` is used.\n",
        "   - **`__repr__`** is used to define a more formal string representation, often used for debugging or development. Itâ€™s called when `repr()` is used or in interactive mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?**\n",
        "   The `super()` function allows you to call methods from a parent class. It is often used in method overriding to call the parent class's method and extend its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "   The `__del__` method is called when an object is about to be destroyed, which can be used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. **What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?**\n",
        "   - **`@staticmethod`** defines a method that doesn't operate on the instance or class, but can be called without access to either.\n",
        "   - **`@classmethod`** defines a method that operates on the class, not the instance, and takes `cls` as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "   In Python, polymorphism allows different subclasses to define methods with the same name. When a method is called on a parent class reference, the appropriate method from the subclass is executed depending on the actual object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "   Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. Each method returns the object itself, allowing subsequent methods to be called on that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?**\n",
        "   The `__call__` method allows an object to be called like a function. When implemented, you can use instances of the class as callable objects.\n"
